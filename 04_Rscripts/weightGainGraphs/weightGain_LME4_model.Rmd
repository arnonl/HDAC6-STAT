## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataPreparation}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(knitr)

##### Set parameters #####

relativeGain <- F
tickEvery <- 20

genderTypes <- c("Males", "Females")
names(genderTypes) <- c("M","F")

# Loads data into R from excel
# 
uDir <- "/Users/Arnon/Post_at_NYU/Projects/Util_codes/"
dataDir <- "/Users/Arnon/Post_at_NYU/Projects/HDAC_study/03_processedData"

data <- read.csv(file = file.path(dataDir, "all_mice_statVsControl.csv"), header = T)
#
longData <- melt.data.frame(
    data, id.vars = c("mouse", "gender", "treatment", "cage", "genotype"))
colnames(longData) <- c(colnames(longData)[1:5], "week", "weight")
head(longData)

# Add numeric time
# patterns within parenthesis are captured and assigned to \\1, \\2, etc. 
# Print out only \\2 which has the numeric part
longData$numTime <- as.numeric(sub("(w)(.)", "\\2", as.character(longData$week), perl = TRUE))

# write.csv(file = file.path(dataDir,"all_mice_longFormat.csv"), longData)
# longData <- read.csv(file = file.path(dataDir,"all_mice_longFormat.csv"), header = T)

# See how many cases we have for each time point
table(longData$week)

# Divide here every category with the first observation of time=0 and save it under wgRatio
# First, let's see how many observation we have for each week
if (var(table(longData$week)) == 0) {
    nEl <- max(table(longData$week))
} else {
    stop("The number of elements are not equal across groups")
}

str(longData)
longData$cage <- factor(longData$cage)
# Add an indication for before and after switch to HFD
longData$onHFD <- factor(c(rep("Before", sum(longData$numTime<8)), rep("After", sum(longData$numTime>=8))))

# Subset to before HFD
longDataBeforeHFD <- subset(longData, onHFD=="Before")
# Subset to HFD only
longDataOnHFD <- subset(longData, longData$numTime >= 8)

```

## Now here are the comparisons of the different models - Including Plots

#### Modelling males

```{r modelingMales , echo=FALSE}

library("devtools")
install_github("hofnerb/papeR")
library(papeR)

packageVersion("lme4")
library(lme4, warn.conflicts = F)

# Ploynomal model
######################
print("Dataset head:")
head(longDataBeforeHFD)
print("Dataset tail:")
tail(longDataBeforeHFD)
colnames(longDataBeforeHFD)

#== Test 1 ==#
# The very basic model with no treatment, random intercept and slope
unconditional.growth.mod <- lmer(weight ~ (numTime + I(numTime^2)) + 
                                     ((numTime + I(numTime^2)) | mouse), data = longDataBeforeHFD)
pretty_lme <- prettify(unconditional.growth.mod)
kable(pretty_lme)
# 

# The very basic model with no treatment, random slope only
unconditional.growth.ranSlope <- lmer(weight ~ (numTime + I(numTime^2)) + 
                                     (0 + (numTime + I(numTime^2)) | mouse), data = longDataBeforeHFD)
# Comparing unconditional model with random slope and intercept with unconditional model with only random slope
anova(update(unconditional.growth.mod, REML=FALSE), update(unconditional.growth.ranSlope, REML=FALSE))

# Conclusion - the random intercept term has a significant effect on the model 

```

```{r plotInteraction}
# Point=True force the graph to show “dot-and-whisker” over “line-and-ribbon”
interplot(m = <modelName>, var1 = <xAxisVar>, var2 = <yAxisVar>, ci = .9, point = T)

```
